SwissTM requires atomic_ops library that can be downloaded
from http://hplabs.hp.com/research/linux/atomic_ops/.

To build the library perform the following steps:

1) Change Makefile.in according to local configuration.

2) Run make.

To build the visible reads SwissTM the second step should be
changed to:

2) Run 'make STM=epochstm'.

As a result, static library and include files will be generated.
Also intset-rbtree executable will be created. This executable
contains red black tree microbenchmark.
