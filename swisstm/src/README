Directory structure is organized as follows:
    api      - Definition of API used for manual instrumentation.
    common   - Files common to different STM implementations. This includes handling tls, various
               constants etc.
    epochstm - Implementation of EpochSTM algorithm.
    include  - Base include file used for manual instrumentation.
    intel    - Files for libitm.a used by transactional icc.
    mubench  - Red-black tree microbenchmark.
    stm      - Implementation of SwissTM algorithm.
    stm_api  - Boilerplate code for reading data of different sizes. Used by api, intel and tanger.
    tanger   - Tanger support.
